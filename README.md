# Progeny Item Scanner

This is a simple scanner that looks for people in the region who are wearing Progeny gear. I used this so I wouldn't get ganked enjoying myself somewhere on the grid. 

I don't use this anymore since I quit Progeny.

It's my understanding that the next version of the Progeny gear will be all HUD so this code to detect attachments won't work if that turns out to be true. 

## Use

Dump the script into a container. Set Firestorm to alert you when that container speaks. 

You can silence alerts aobut individuals with 

```
/7 add <UUID> 
```

and reset the silence list with 

```
/7 reset
```
